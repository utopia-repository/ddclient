Yet again it's been a while but here is new release of ddclient. As usual,
there are some important changes and some documentation is modified.
A detailed overview can be found in ChangeLog but here's a quick overview:

	* support ipv6 for cloudfare
	* added suppport for freemyip
	* adding configurable TTL to Cloudflare
	* added support for woima.fi dyndns service
	* added support for google domain

A very big thank you for everyone who created a pull request on github and
for everyone who helped to fix the little issues caused by the new providers.
